MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Random uP error 
CURE: In case of random uP error one of the following phenomenons occur: - Display segments are activated in a random order (lightshow on the display) - No reaction on pressed buttons, hang-up of the software - Self-reset of the front-OTP Replace than the built-in front-OTP (pos.7401) by the mask-version: 7401 4822 209 33151TMP47CM71AF-6146 REMARKS: Concerns set produced between production weeks 9340-9342 The phenomenon is only reproducible at operation temperatures > 40 degrees centrigrade (celsius). At an ambient temp. of 20 degrees the warm-up takes between 1 and 2 hours.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: In some cases DCC cleaning cassette SBC3500 does not work properly. 
CURE: This problem is caused by a too long capstan (marginal difference compared with DCC900) which carries the cleaning cassette from the inside. In this case the DCC sensor switches are not activated and cassette is not accepted. Either fix a piece of adhesive tape at the bottom side of the cassette housing or drill a hole of 4.5 mm through the housing. REMARKS : Existing stock of Philips Service Warehouse is being reworked by drilling the hole. New stock will arrive with a thinner housing at the position the capstan is touching the housing.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Sometimes the use-again marker not found on customer recorded DCC. 
CURE: (Endless loops during append) Cut off minus lead of Electrolytic Capacitor 2711 on read/write board. Solder wire from minus lead of 2711 to pin 11 of IC 7703 (Read amplifier TDA1317). REMARKS : This phenomenon occurs only on Printed Circuit Boards with production stage .4 and is caused by crosstalk from WDATA to INAUX signal line.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Noisy tray, squeaking sound during open/close 
CURE: Grease guiding parts of drawer pos. 209 resp. catch lever assembly pos. 216. with Molykote, service code 4822 390 20139.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Cassette gets stuck behind the front when lifted at left side 
CURE: This occurs when cassette is lifted at left side in order to remove it from the opened tray. The switch is opened/closed by a ridge, located at the back righthand corner of the drawer. To delay the switch actuation cut off some plastic of the ridge. Attention: This modification also takes an influence on the feature touch to close. If too much plastic is removed the tray might already close while a cassette is inserted ! Try to find an optimal compromise. CAUSE: The drawer (pos. 209) does not open far enough, because the tray-out switch (pos. 1437) is actuated too early. REMARKS: This publication will be followed by a service information.

MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Modification 
CURE: Modification In course of production the power supply circuitry of the read/write board has been changed: * Double-diode pos. 6703 (BAV99 - 5322 130 34337) has been built-in in series to the voltage stabilizers 7701 and 7702. The double-diode reduces the input voltage of the stabilizers and thus the power dissipation of these ICs. * Voltage stabilizer pos. 7708 has been changed to a type with low voltage drop (LM2931Z-5.0 - 5322 209 60749), capacitor pos. 2764 is changed from 10nF to 10Ã¦F (4822 124 23179). Both actions improve the plop-behaviour when the set is powered-off during a recording session from an analog source. REMARKS: Modifications have been taken place in read/write boards from production stage .5 onwards. Production stage can be identified by the last digit of the twelve-figure number, located at the lower right corner of the printed circuit board.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Initialising DCC 
CURE: Initialising DCC NEW DCC CASSETTE: How to initialize the cassette (= making a lead-in recording at the beginning of the tape) is stated in the Instructions for Use. In the various typenumbers the following keys have to be activated: For DCC091, DCC450: REWIND, APPEND For DCC170: REWIND, REC PAUSE For DCC300, DCC380: REWIND, APPEND For DCC600: REWIND, APPEND For DCC730, DCC951: REWIND, REC SELECT/PAUSE For DCC900: REWIND, APPEND For more details: see Instructions for Use of concerned typenumber; chapter recording. After this initialization the track number and (absolute) time information will be recorded on the user-recorded tape. The above shown survey is a simplified universal applyable operation. The most problems are caused by the fact that users are accustomed to apply the record function straight forward, like recording ACC-cassettes. PARTIALLY RECORDED For all typenumbers, except DCC170: Use APPEND to search for end of last recording in case of partially recorded DCC-tape and so proper coupling of old and new recordings is made. For DCC170: Search Manually for END indication of last recording and make new recordings from that spot onwards. OVERWRITING In case of completely overwriting a user-recorded DCC-tape the initializing procedure has to be performed again! CONCLUSION: It is very important to initialize a user-recorded DCC-tape. If a DCC-tape is initialized or not, can easily be seen on the display information in Play-back mode. Starting at the beginning of the tape track time An empty DCC tape:: Not initialized DCC tape (User format) 11 : 24 Initialized DCC tape (Super-user format)312 : 49

MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Customer problems when using DCC 
CURE: Customer problems when using DCC In general playing back pre-recorded DCC-cassettes does not bring problems to users, because playback of such a cassette is more or less simular to operating a CD-player. A number of problems are found in the playing back and/or recording of the user-recorded DCC-cassettes, caused by not proper 'initializing' of ALL these cassettes. Initializing is important because this is closely linked to basic customer-expectations of a digital product: - Track number; - Time indication. The DCC-standard distinguishes 2 different formats of user-recorded DCC-tapes: a. Super-user format b. User format But there are also combinations of the 2 user-recorded formats possible: c. Combinations of the 2 formats. And there is the pre-recorded DCC tape format: d. Pre-recorded DCC SUMMARIZED CHARACTERISTICS: a. Super-user format: - continuous absolute time information available (remaining time is calculated by the set) - Track numbering and track title at start of track are possible. (this means that also renumber is possible) - Initialization required - TOC (Table of Contents) possible at start of track 1 For figures see Audio Service newsletter 63.01 On Display when super-user format is loaded at position a: TRACKTIME - -10:51 b. User format: - No continuous absolute time information available on tape - No track numbering/title. (this means that renumber is not possible) - No initialization required The start markers are only used for track access. On Display when user format is loaded at position b: TRACKTIME : Notice: track is blank! Some DCC typenumbers show counter settings, others the estimated time based on the tacho-signals. c. Combination of the 2 formats. - This format usually happens when the APPEND function is not used. - The APPEND function is designed to guarantee the Super-user format in case a recording is made at the end of a partially recorded tape. When a recording is started on a blank area, the result will always be a User-format. Correction by renumbering is not possible. d. Pre-recorded DCC - Continuous time information available (inclusive absolute time, track time, remaining time etc.) - Track information continuous available - TOC information continuous available - Track title information continuous available. - Display will show on what ever position loaded the track and time information. example: TRACKTIME 210:51

SYMPTOM: Codenumber information 
CURE: Codenumber information DCC Cleaning cassette SBC3500 is from now on available with service codenumber 4822 015 20646.
MODEL: DCC450 
SYMPTOM: Noisy fan 
CURE: Noisy fan - Customer complains that the built-in fan is too noisy (fan runs continuously). For that reason a modification of the fan-control circuit has been implemented. Now fan is only switched on when the temperature in the set exceeds a defined limit. In practice the fan will be switched on after approx. 1.5 hours of operation. For adapted circuit diagram and location of NTC-sensor board see the prepared service information. A modification-kit can be ordered on special request. REMARKS : Temperature dependent fan-control is already built-in in sets with factory change code WT01 onwards. This publication will be followed by a service information.

SYMPTOM: Sometimes no sound on right speaker. 
CURE: Check Dig.PCB 4822 214 33899.
MODEL: DCC600 
SYMPTOM: Sound distorsion by interfering of a TV set. 
CURE: When the set is placed in the neighbourhood of a TV set (K40 type) the sound from the DCC is distorted. The distortion disappears as soon as the TV set is switched-off. As all DCC recorder complies the Philips requirements concerning magnetic fields it is advised to rearrange the set-up. It is known that some strong fields will interfere with the head connections. For this reason in the IFU is published: Do not place the DCC...near magnetic fields ... , ..) Placing the DCC at the other side of the TV-set (away from the high voltage transformer) can solve the problem. Adding an additional metal screen is also possible but is not a 'nice' solution in a home set-up.

SYMPTOM: Adjustment head current 
CURE: Adjustment head current - In case the read/write head of the DCC mechancism should be exchanged and/or the read/write IC's are defective the head current has to be re-adjusted. Because at this moment the needed test equipment is not available, this will be done in a central repair procedure. The following codenumbers are resorted in this repair procedure, at Philips Consumer Service known with code (REPARI 1 and 4): For 70DCC900: The complete tape deck mechanism item service codenumber 001M 4822 691 20777 For 70DCC300, 70DCC380 and 70DCC600: The complete loading mechanism item service codenumber LDU4822 691 20833 and The complete digital board (PCB5) item service codenumber 4822 214 33899 In case of a repair one has to ship, without waiting, the defective item to: Invoice to: Philips Consumer Electronics B.V. 670005 Consumer Service - Price centre 5600 MD Eindhoven building SBP5 The Netherlands Ship to: Philips Consumer Electronics B.V. 676723 Consumer Service 5600 MD Eindhoven building SDM5 The Netherlands ATT: Mr. C.

MODEL: DCC600 
SYMPTOM: Trackselection 
CURE: Trackselection Direct track access is meant to search a wanted tracknumber by taking the shortest path to get to the track. Due to the differences in possible tapes, this topic is rather complex: * On a pre-recorded DCC tape, the Table Of Contents is always recorded continuously on the tape. This means that direct track access is possible. When jumping from track 3 to track 8. In this case the side is changed (from A to B) This is the SHORT SEARCH. * On a user-recorded tape, the Table Of Contents (TOC) cannot be recorded continuously. The TOC has be adapted all over the tape as soon as the recording on the tape is changed. For this reason the TOC can only be written at the start of track 1. This means that now jumping from track 3 to 8 results in so called SEQUENCIAL TRACK SEARCH. Jumping from track 3 to track 8 is done via track 4, 5, 6, and 7. In practise it has become clear that when a DCC is loaded, it is in many cases not positioned at the start of track 1. This means that the only alternative is sequential track search: The deck will in some cases not take the shortest path as the location of the required track is unknown. IMPLEMENTATION: DCC900 Writing TOC on user-recorded DCC was planned but did not fit into the microprocessor internal ROM capacity. To delete this possibility from the specification was a last minute decision. Unfortunately the Instruction For Use has not been adapted accordingly. That is why 10-key commands are not accepted (NO TOC message). There is no service solution available. DCC600 Writing TOC on user-recorded tape was also not possible because of the limitations of the microprocessor internal ROM capacity. Lessons are taken from DCC900, that is why the sequential search possibility has been implemented. When a 10-key command is issued and the TOC is not known, the deck will perform this above described sequential search. The result is that DCC600 will in only a few cases not respond to a 10-key command. Due to the fact that the microprocessor of the DCC900 is completely filled and no larger memory is available, a service solution which incorporates sequential search like DCC600 is not possible.

SYMPTOM: Modification speed control 
CURE: Modification speed control In the course of production the temperature stability circuit of the speed control has been improved. This may influence the compatibility of the LDU1000 loading assy (4822 691 20833). This loading has to match with the various versions of the main pcb because components on PCB3 (main pcb) and PCB6 (dcc-indicator) have been changed. Situation Loading marked LDU1000 WT00 and WT01: PCB3: R3262 (12k) with parallel to it potentiometer 3264 (10k). In series with this 3263 (12k). PCB6: NTC-resistor 3160 (150R) in series with capstan motor. Situation Loading marked LDU1000 WT02: PCB3: R3262 (deleted), potentiometer 3264 (4k7). In series with this potentiometer 3263 (15k). PCB6: Resistor 3160 (100k) in series with diode 6601 (kathode at 3263 and - (MINUS) capstan motor, anode at 3160) parallel to capstan motor. Therefore: In case the loading assy with with printed board PCB6 has to be replaced the built-in main pcb has to be matched to the production stage of the LDU1000 delivered.

CURE: Corrections to the service manual - The service test program (page 25-26) Key test : Correct key to enter this test is 'MARK WRITE' Hole test: This test can only be entered if tray is in opened position. In tray test the tray is moved outside. So first start with tray test before hole test. IR test: RC-5 codes of TEXT and TIME have been exchanged in this publication. RC-5 code for TIME should read '11', RC-5 code for TEXT should read '122'. Adjustment table (page 28) Position number of potentiometer for take-up torque should read 3280. REMARKS: This publication will be followed by service information A93-362
MODEL: DCC600 
SYMPTOM: Modification 
CURE: Modification In course of production the power supply circuitry of the read/write board has been changed: * Double-diode pos. 6703 (BAV99 - 5322 130 34337) has been built-in in series to the voltage stabilizers 7701 and 7702. The double-diode reduces the input voltage of the stabilizers and thus the power dissipation of these ICs. * Voltage stabilizer pos. 7708 has been changed to a type with low voltage drop (LM2931Z-5.0 - 5322 209 60749), capacitor pos. 2764 is changed from 10nF to 10Ã¦F (4822 124 23179). Both actions improve the plop-behaviour when the set is powered-off during a recording session from an analog source. REMARKS: Modifications have been taken place in read/write boards from production stage .5 onwards. Production stage can be identified by the last digit of the twelve-figure number, located at the lower right corner of the printed circuit board.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: DCC head defect, no recording, several isolation shorts on DCC head. 
CURE: Isolation shorts are caused by ESD. To protect against ESD replace (or bridge) C2999 on Read/Write panel by a 4k7 resistor (4822 051 20472). It is advised to introduce this in all sets with which will be offered for repair, and the modification has not yet been implemented yet. Implementation date: In R/W boards from production week 9540 onwards.

SYMPTOM: OPERATING: Operate DCC recorder 
CURE: Problem: It is difficult to operate DCC recorde. Cause: DCC recorder is software controlled (play back = CD similar). REMARKS : Correct understandings of the user-recorded tape formats and markers will help customers to make full use of the benefits of the DCC recorder. See also newsletter 63.01. For ease of operationg a quick reference card is made available: For DCC730 with service code 4822 725 22612 For DCC951 with service code 4822 725 22611 These reference cards contain clear pictograms to operate the DCC recorder for every mode.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: OPERATING: Renumbering 
CURE: Problem: Renumbering not possible when making a new recording at specific location. Cause: In User format is RENUMBER not possible. REMARKS : Before recording first initializing of the tape has to be performed. See also newsletter item 63.01
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: OPERATING: Music passages are lost 
CURE: Problem: Music passages are lost after renumbering. Cause: 'CONTINUE B' (REVERSE) and 'GO TO START A' (STOP) marker cannot be erased. REMARKS : Markers which are recorded on the tape, control the set in play back mode. This means that in PLAY mode all information recorded on tape behind the 'Continue B' marker or 'Go to Start A' marker is skipped. The recordings behind those markers can only be reached by winding over that marker.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: OPERATING: Track numbering 
CURE: Problem: Track numbering does not start at number 1 when recording side B. Cause: Per default single Album format is defined. REMARKS : Track numbering starts at side A (when AUTO EDIT ON) directly after the LEAD-IN area with number 1. Track numbering is automatically incremented when recording new tracks and continues on side B. In other words the DCC tape is seen as one single album where one may select a particular track, and it does not matter whether the required track is on side A or B of the tape. If user wants to start track numbering with track 1 on side B to obtain e.g. a dual Album, EDIT function must be performed. When in REC-PAUSE mode: - - press EDIT key to enter the edit mode - select required EDIT function by pressing EDIT several times - press RECORD key to actually edit the tape. Next edit functions are available: - - START NEW SIDE: to start track numbering on side B with track number 1. When restarting of track numbering is required, user must search for last recording on side A, record START NEW SIDE indication. - CONTINUE B: track numbering is continued at side B. - GO TO START A: marks the position where the deck should start winding to the beginning of side A and stop.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Analog level 
CURE: Problem: Analog level cannot be reduced until zero using REC LEVEL control. Cause: No analog fade in/out option available. REMARKS : Recording level control is not meant to obtain fade in/out effects for own analog recordings. Typical fade in/out feature is not available on DCC sets. Analog recording level control is meant to be used for adapting input level for analog signals. To obtain real fade in/out effects an audio mixing unit (e.g. SBC5370), connected to AUX - ANALOG IN, should be applied.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Clicks are audible 
CURE: Problem: Clicks are audible when interrupting recording with REC PAUSE. Cause: Difference between digital mute (-110dB) and analog silence (>-30dB) can be recognized as click being recorded. REMARKS : By mixing different titles (from e.g. various Vinyl Records) clicks are audible between the analog silence signal of the vinyl recording and the interrupting of the recording with REC PAUSE (digital mute). It is this difference in level between the analog silence and the digital mute (system detects a sudden increase of level) that the DCC recorder records, and is audible as a click during play back at high volume level.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: PLAYBACK: DCC cassettes 
CURE: Problem: DCC cassettes causing faults (a.o. drop outs, tape salad, clean head). Cause: DCC cassettes outside specification. REMARKS: The used DCC cassette is not according the DCC specification and so NOT released by Philips. (e.g. some of Maxell and Fuji cassettes) It is recommended to use released Philips DCC cassettes only.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: PLAYBACK: Skipping small part of music 
CURE: Problem: Skipping small part of music of pre-recorded DCC-cassettes after track search Cause: Repositioning problem due to high fast wind/rewind speed. REMARKS: After track search command the DCC does not start exactly at the beginning of a track. First approx. 500 msec. of track are not played back. This problem does not occur when DCC-cassette is played-back normally. This deviation is dependant on the position of the tape; via the reel-tacho signals the movement of the reel is measured not the tape. To reduce this error a compensation is done, based on an average required repositioning within Â± 0.5 sec. Only in the minus area this short jump could be noticed. This problem cannot be solved.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: TRACK AND TIME: REMaining time 
CURE: Problem: REMaining time indication is not reliable. Cause: Calculation of remaining time by DCC recorder REMARKS : The DCC recorder starts with defining an estimated total remaining time. After that it calculates the elapsed time by reading total time information of played back tracks. The remaining time left on tape is the estimated playing time of the cassette minus the elapsed time. The remaining time might have a tolerance of about 1 minute. So it might happen that for instance the display shows 'REM TIME 5:38, and yet a music piece of about 4:14 will not fit.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: TRACK AND TIME: Track and Time information is erased 
CURE: Problem: Track and Time information is erased when adding text information. Cause: Not correct initialized cassette. REMARKS : Sometimes track number and time information is erased when recording text information. When using RENUMBER to reconstruct the track numbering again the missing time information will be misinterpreted as tape end and tape direction is reversed, while renumbering continues on side B.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: OPERATING: Operation of source selector 
CURE: Problem: Operation of source selector is not clear. Cause: IFU does not explain selection of source very clear. REMARKS : After installation of the DCC recorder all input sources should be selected via source preset. This is done as follows: - Press PRESET - By pressing REC SELECT/PAUSE the default CD is indicated on display. By pressing NEXT key the cable connection made with CD player can be selected. By pressing again REC SELECT/PAUSE the next input source (tuner etc) can be selected. Every time again the applied cable connection with source can be selected via the NEXT key. - When all sources (to be recorded from) via REC SELECT/PAUSE and NEXT are selected these presettings are stored by pressing PRESET. Making a recording from one of the sources the latest used source (this setting is also stored by the set) is selected. If another source should be selected this is done as follows: - Press REC SELECT/PAUSE, the default source is already indicated on display (except Microphone). - By pressing REC SELECT/PAUSE again next source is selected. - Subsequently pressing REC SELECT/PAUSE gives the other available sources. Sequence of source selection is CD TUNER AUX1 AUX2 CD TUNER, etc. In case microphone socket has been connected this input source is selected automatically. NOTE:In case a digital recording will be made from CD or AUX as source and no digital connection is made the message: 'CHECK DIG IN' is displayed and one should reconnect digital cable from recorder to source. For more detailed information See the Instructions for Use. A quick reference card for ease of operating is made available: For DCC730 with service code 4822 725 22612 For DCC951 with service code 4822 725 22611 These reference cards contain clear pictographs to operate the DCC recorder.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: OPERATING: AUTO STOP mode 
CURE: Problem: DCC recorder does not stop after last recording when selected AUTO STOP mode. Cause: Auto stop function is wrongly interpreted by user. REMARKS : With the PRESETS function the playback function can be set as soon as a cassette is inserted. With playback set at AUTO PLAY, playback will always be started automatically as soon as the tray has been closed (and cassette is inserted) by pushing the tray by hand or the POWER has been switched ON. With playback set at AUTO STOP, playback will not start automatically. NOTE:To find last recording user should use APPEND to search for the end of the last recording (which was marked when STOP was pressed during recording). APP > or APP < appears. When this position has been found the last 10 seconds will be played back (APPEND PLAY), after which the RECORD PAUSE (REC-P) mode is entered.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Old recordings remain 
CURE: Problem: Parts of old recordings remain after overwriting existing recordings. Cause: Cassette is not initialized correctly before overwriting. REMARKS : When a CD-synchro recording is made on a DCC-tape which was already recorded in the past, the set switches at the estimated end from side A to side B. When playing back this part of the tape first the 'new' music is heard followed by the 'old' music until end of side A and in the beginning of side B. This problem can be prevented by renumbering the tape. NOTE: To overwrite a previous recorded DCC tape press REWIND key more than 0.5 second (set must be in STOP mode). Tape is rewound to the beginning of the tape. By pressing REC SELECT/PAUSE key the LEAD IN portion of about 10 seconds is recorded. Afterwards the set goes to Record Pause mode. When pressing RECORD the recording starts and tape will be completely overwritten. Set 'sees' tape as being new. To record in the middle of an existing track (recording on a specific location) first the location should be searched, than (in STOP mode) press subsequently REC SELECT/PAUSE and RECORD.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Track numbering 
CURE: Problem: Track numbering DCC does not match with the track numbering of the source (e.g. when digital copying a Compact Disc) Cause: Track number is automatically increased at end of side A with CD SYNCHRO OFF. REMARKS : At end of side A a CONTINUE B marker is recorded. The DCC standard requires a new track number at the start of side B. This marker is not on the CD, so all recordings from side B have a track number (CD track number + 1).
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Track numbering 
CURE: Problem: Track numbering does not match with the track numbering of the source (e.g. when analog copying a Compact Disc). Cause: Track number is recorded after an analog silence (signal level below -60dB) for more than 3 seconds and track number is automatically increased at end of side A with CD SYNCHRO OFF. REMARKS : - In AUTO EDIT ON mode a new track number will be written after every silence for more than 3 seconds, where 'silence' is defined as an analog signal level below -60dB. It might happen that a source (Compact Disc) has music pauses for more than 3 seconds within one music number, or pauses between tracks are shorter than 3 seconds. User may edit the track numbering afterwards by CONNECTing or SPLITting TRACKS. By connecting tracks the current and next 'pause' track will be connected and later on recognized as one track. During this action the DCC recorder will erase the START indication of that 'pause' track. By splitting tracks the current track will be split up in two successive tracks. - DCC standard requires a new track number at the start of side B. (See also problem RECORDING: Writing markers in AUDIO EDIT) NOTE:When tracks have been connected or splitted also a RENUMBER action is necessary to ensure a correct track number sequence.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: PLAYBACK: CLEAN HEAD 
CURE: Problem: CLEAN HEAD indication Cause: Contaminated head. REMARKS : The special design of DCC-head makes it sensitive for contamination, especially when low quality ACC tape (Fe tape) is used. The applied DCC tape consists of high quality chrome tape, which will not contaminate the head. In order to ensure high quality recording the warning of the CLEAN HEAD indication is displayed according following criteria: - about 8 hours of total playing back time of ACC tape. - 2 channels or more on DCC tape not detected by DCC head for more than 3 seconds. please notice:In case CLEAN HEAD indication was caused by a temporarily bad HEAD-TAPE contact, the message will disappear after pressing the 'TIME' or 'TEXT' key.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Writing markers in AUTO EDIT 
CURE: Problem: Writing markers in AUTO EDIT mode after more than 3 seconds of silence. Cause: IFU mentions 3 seconds of silence. REMARKS : In AUTO EDIT ON mode the DCC recorder writes new track numbers on the tape when silences (signal level below -60dB) of more than 3 seconds are detected during recording from ANALOG input. The signal level of the source must be below -60dB before DCC system recognizes a music pause. It might happen that during fading out of music, the user perceives a silence but that signal level is not dropped below -60dB. In this case the music pause seems to be much longer than 3 seconds. Note: In AUTO EDIT OFF the DCC recorder will not perform automatic track increment when recording from analog sources. AUTO EDIT is always set to ON when a digital source is connected (via digital sockets).
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: RECORDING: Microphone recording input 
CURE: Problem: Microphone recording input is only Mono Cause: Only Mono microphone pre-amplifier designed. REMARKS : When microphone is connected, the DCC set automatically selects the MONO microphone input. Recording via another source is not possible as long as microphone is connected. When Stereo recording via microphone is required it is recommended to connect microphone(s) to an audio mixing unit (e.g. SBC5370) which must be connected to AUX, ANALOG IN.
MODEL: DCC730 
SYMPTOM: PLAYBACK: De-emphasis 
CURE: Problem: De-emphasis in DCC player is not functioning after making a digital copy of a Compact Disc. Cause: In PLAYBACK mode the DCC recorder switches de-emphasis ON or OFF dependant to the contents of the system information (SYSINFO). REMARKS : De-emphasis of a DCC recording is only activated in PLAYBACK mode if concerned bit in sysinfo is switched on. This flag is set during recording from digital input. This information is sent from the CD player to the DCC recorder. In play back the DCC recorder switches de-emphasis on or off dependant of the flag setting in sysinfo. Recording via analog input will not set the de-emphasis flag. This is already performed in the CD player via the information in the SUBCODE. Manually on/off switching of de-emphasis by user is not possible.

SYMPTOM: Initialising DCC 
CURE: Initialising DCC NEW DCC CASSETTE: How to initialize the cassette (= making a lead-in recording at the beginning of the tape) is stated in the Instructions for Use. In the various typenumbers the following keys have to be activated: For DCC091, DCC450: REWIND, APPEND For DCC170: REWIND, REC PAUSE For DCC300, DCC380: REWIND, APPEND For DCC600: REWIND, APPEND For DCC730, DCC951: REWIND, REC SELECT/PAUSE For DCC900: REWIND, APPEND For more details: see Instructions for Use of concerned typenumber; chapter recording. After this initialization the track number and (absolute) time information will be recorded on the user-recorded tape. The above shown survey is a simplified universal applyable operation. The most problems are caused by the fact that users are accustomed to apply the record function straight forward, like recording ACC-cassettes. PARTIALLY RECORDED For all typenumbers, except DCC170: Use APPEND to search for end of last recording in case of partially recorded DCC-tape and so proper coupling of old and new recordings is made. For DCC170: Search Manually for END indication of last recording and make new recordings from that spot onwards. OVERWRITING In case of completely overwriting a user-recorded DCC-tape the initializing procedure has to be performed again! CONCLUSION: It is very important to initialize a user-recorded DCC-tape. If a DCC-tape is initialized or not, can easily be seen on the display information in Play-back mode. Starting at the beginning of the tape track time An empty DCC tape:: Not initialized DCC tape (User format) 11 : 24 Initialized DCC tape (Super-user format)312 : 49

SYMPTOM: Customer problems when using DCC 
CURE: Customer problems when using DCC In general playing back pre-recorded DCC-cassettes does not bring problems to users, because playback of such a cassette is more or less simular to operating a CD-player. A number of problems are found in the playing back and/or recording of the user-recorded DCC-cassettes, caused by not proper 'initializing' of ALL these cassettes. Initializing is important because this is closely linked to basic customer-expectations of a digital product: - Track number; - Time indication. The DCC-standard distinguishes 2 different formats of user-recorded DCC-tapes: a. Super-user format b. User format But there are also combinations of the 2 user-recorded formats possible: c. Combinations of the 2 formats. And there is the pre-recorded DCC tape format: d. Pre-recorded DCC SUMMARIZED CHARACTERISTICS: a. Super-user format: - continuous absolute time information available (remaining time is calculated by the set) - Track numbering and track title at start of track are possible. (this means that also renumber is possible) - Initialization required - TOC (Table of Contents) possible at start of track 1 For figures see Audio Service newsletter 63.01 On Display when super-user format is loaded at position a: TRACKTIME - -10:51 b. User format: - No continuous absolute time information available on tape - No track numbering/title. (this means that renumber is not possible) - No initialization required The start markers are only used for track access. On Display when user format is loaded at position b: TRACKTIME : Notice: track is blank! Some DCC typenumbers show counter settings, others the estimated time based on the tacho-signals. c. Combination of the 2 formats. - This format usually happens when the APPEND function is not used. - The APPEND function is designed to guarantee the Super-user format in case a recording is made at the end of a partially recorded tape. When a recording is started on a blank area, the result will always be a User-format. Correction by renumbering is not possible. d. Pre-recorded DCC - Continuous time information available (inclusive absolute time, track time, remaining time etc.) - Track information continuous available - TOC information continuous available - Track title information continuous available. - Display will show on what ever position loaded the track and time information. example: TRACKTIME 210:51

SYMPTOM: Multi-room system is not functioning well with remote control. 
CURE: Especially occuring with other sets of C9 series. While DCC900 is operating with the remote control in Room 2 ('speakers' set-up room), there is no sound output from the speakers. This happens only in the play-back mode with a pre-recorded tape and the direct track number search command. This is caused by the not correct easy link code output from the ESI-bus of the 70DCC900. Only in case the user complaints about this phenomenon the front uP (QD01) has to be replaced by the OTP ÂµP(4822 209 52437). In case a set does not be equiped with the pull-down resistors (GD01 - GD04), the resistor arrays should be added.

(this means that also renumber is possible) - Initialization required - TOC (Table of Contents) possible at start of track 1 For figures see Audio Service newsletter 63.01 On Display when super-user format is loaded at position a: TRACKTIME - -10:51 b. User format: - No continuous absolute time information available on tape - No track numbering/title. (this means that renumber is not possible) - No initialization required The start markers are only used for track access. On Display when user format is loaded at position b: TRACKTIME : Notice: track is blank! Some DCC typenumbers show counter settings, others the estimated time based on the tacho-signals. c. Combination of the 2 formats. - This format usually happens when the APPEND function is not used. - The APPEND function is designed to guarantee the Super-user format in case a recording is made at the end of a partially recorded tape. When a recording is started on a blank area, the result will always be a User-format. Correction by renumbering is not possible. d. Pre-recorded DCC - Continuous time information available (inclusive absolute time, track time, remaining time etc.) - Track information continuous available - TOC information continuous available - Track title information continuous available. - Display will show on what ever position loaded the track and time information. example: TRACKTIME 210:51

SYMPTOM: Trackselection 
CURE: Trackselection Direct track access is meant to search a wanted tracknumber by taking the shortest path to get to the track. Due to the differences in possible tapes, this topic is rather complex: * On a pre-recorded DCC tape, the Table Of Contents is always recorded continuously on the tape. This means that direct track access is possible. When jumping from track 3 to track 8. In this case the side is changed (from A to B) This is the SHORT SEARCH. * On a user-recorded tape, the Table Of Contents (TOC) cannot be recorded continuously. The TOC has be adapted all over the tape as soon as the recording on the tape is changed. For this reason the TOC can only be written at the start of track 1. This means that now jumping from track 3 to 8 results in so called SEQUENCIAL TRACK SEARCH. Jumping from track 3 to track 8 is done via track 4, 5, 6, and 7. In practise it has become clear that when a DCC is loaded, it is in many cases not positioned at the start of track 1. This means that the only alternative is sequential track search: The deck will in some cases not take the shortest path as the location of the required track is unknown. IMPLEMENTATION: DCC900 Writing TOC on user-recorded DCC was planned but did not fit into the microprocessor internal ROM capacity. To delete this possibility from the specification was a last minute decision. Unfortunately the Instruction For Use has not been adapted accordingly. That is why 10-key commands are not accepted (NO TOC message). There is no service solution available. DCC600 Writing TOC on user-recorded tape was also not possible because of the limitations of the microprocessor internal ROM capacity. Lessons are taken from DCC900, that is why the sequential search possibility has been implemented. When a 10-key command is issued and the TOC is not known, the deck will perform this above described sequential search. The result is that DCC600 will in only a few cases not respond to a 10-key command. Due to the fact that the microprocessor of the DCC900 is completely filled and no larger memory is available, a service solution which incorporates sequential search like DCC600 is not possible.

SYMPTOM: Updating uPs 
CURE: Updating uPs During the course of production the uPs in 70DCC900 have been modified. Sets produced between stamp MZ03 and MZ07lot30 have old versions. In case one of the two uPs has to be exchanged, in those sets, the other uP has to be replaced by a new version too, because in spare parts warehouse only the last versions are taken on stock. From MZ07lot30 (production week 9248) onwards QU01 reads uPD75518GF-085 (available with service code 4822 209 31936) according to Service Newsletter information 39.18. and QD01 reads uPD75238GJ-063 (available with service code 4822 209 31937) according to Service Newsletter information 42.40

SYMPTOM: Initialising DCCE 
CURE: Initialising DCC NEW DCC CASSETTE: How to initialize the cassette (= making a lead-in recording at the beginning of the tape) is stated in the Instructions for Use. In the various typenumbers the following keys have to be activated: For DCC091, DCC450: REWIND, APPEND For DCC170: REWIND, REC PAUSE For DCC300, DCC380: REWIND, APPEND For DCC600: REWIND, APPEND For DCC730, DCC951: REWIND, REC SELECT/PAUSE For DCC900: REWIND, APPEND For more details: see Instructions for Use of concerned typenumber; chapter recording. After this initialization the track number and (absolute) time information will be recorded on the user-recorded tape. The above shown survey is a simplified universal applyable operation. The most problems are caused by the fact that users are accustomed to apply the record function straight forward, like recording ACC-cassettes. PARTIALLY RECORDED For all typenumbers, except DCC170: Use APPEND to search for end of last recording in case of partially recorded DCC-tape and so proper coupling of old and new recordings is made. For DCC170: Search Manually for END indication of last recording and make new recordings from that spot onwards. OVERWRITING In case of completely overwriting a user-recorded DCC-tape the initializing procedure has to be performed again! CONCLUSION: It is very important to initialize a user-recorded DCC-tape. If a DCC-tape is initialized or not, can easily be seen on the display information in Play-back mode.
