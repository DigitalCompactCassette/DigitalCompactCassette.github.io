# [Documentation](..)/[Service Manuals](.)
This directory contains a number of service manuals for various DCC recorders and players of various brands. Most of the service manuals were downloaded from the Internet.

## [DCC175/DCC170 Service Manual](./DCC170%20DCC175%20Service%20Manual.zip)
The DCC175 was an 18 bit portable DCC recorder developed by Marantz. No support for track/title display for super-user tapes, but it can be connected to a computer using the PC-link cable. The mechanism is identical to the DCC170 and there are commonalities in the schematics between the DCC170 and DCC175 too, but it's not possible to hack the DCC170 to make it into a DCC175: the PCB designs are very different.
   
The DCC175 service manual consisted of the DCC170 manual with a few dozen pages describing the differences between the DCC175 and the DCC170. Waling Tiersma provided a paper copy of the service manual, and Jac Goudsmit scanned it at the highest resolution that his dad's scanner supported: 300dpi.

### Known errata
On page 010.jpg, near the bottom, there are 8 buffers drawn, six of which are used to buffer the signals to the PC-link connector (which is on page 011.jpg, bottom right). The buffer for SBDAI (QA54-2/2, grid reference I10) is drawn the wrong way and a pin numbers is wrong: The output is pin 3, not 2 and data goes from the bottom to the top.

## [Optimus DCT-2000 (part 1)](./optimus_dct-2000_1.pdf) [(part 2)](./optimus_dct-2000_2.pdf)
This is the DCC recorder that RadioShack sold in the United States and elsewhere. These documents are not complete service manuals but do give some information. Most of the DCT-2000 was developed by Optimus/RadioShack (probably RCA/Thompson) but they used a mechanism and two plugin boards from Philips.
