## [Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) - Matsushita and Philips Develop New Standard](./Digital%20Compact%20Cassette%20(DCC)%20-%20Matsushita%20and%20Philips%20Develop%20New%20Standard.pdf)
This was downloaded from [www.cieri.net](http://www.cieri.net/Documenti/Documenti%20audio/Digital%20Compact%20Cassette%20(DCC)%20-%20Matsushita%20and%20Philips%20Develop%20New%20Standard.pdf). I found it via Google when I looked for "DCC tape frame".

The website that shares it, claims to have context information for most of its downloads but I can't find the document through the menus, let alone any accompanying text about where it originated (the website is in Italian and my Italian is not very good). It appears that this may have been a hand-out given to those that were present at a Matsushita announcement of the DCC format. It contains lots of interesting details that are not otherwise available to the public, such as bit rates of binary data streams, and the length and formatting of tape blocks and tape frames. This really helps when reading the datasheets of e.g. the Drive Processors where the reader is assumed to have this information.
