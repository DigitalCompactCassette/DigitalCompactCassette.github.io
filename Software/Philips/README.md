# Philips Software
This software was distributed to owners of the DCC-175 recorder. Philips owns the rights to this software, but we post it here without permission because of Fair Use considerations.

Fair Use under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) depends on the Four Factors:

* Purpose and character of the use
* Nature of the copyrighted work
* Amount and substantiality of the portion taken
* Effect of the use upon the potential market

### Purpose
The software is reproduced for archival purpose, to make it available to those who may have lost the original media (floppy disks) or the devices to read the original media (floppy drives).

It may also be used to do some reverse-engineering to make it possible to optimize the use of the DCC-175 recorder and/or other recorders. This is covered by the rules in the DMCA for Transformative Use.

### Nature
The copyrighted work is an old piece of software that only works with the DCC-175 recorder and the PC-link cable which had to be purchased from Philips, and was included with that hardware. Without that hardware, the software is useless, and those who have the hardware already have a license to use the software. 

### Amount
The entire software is reproduced, because a partial reproduction would be useless.

### Effect on Potential Market
The DCC format was discontinued in 1997, and the software has no perceptible use other than nostalgia and archival.
