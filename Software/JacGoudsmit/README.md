## DCC Convert [(16 bit version)](dccconv.zip) / [(32 bit version)](dccconv32.zip)
This command line utility reads PASC encoded .MPP files from the DCC-Studio program, and converts them into MPEG-1 files that can be played by decoders that don't understand the padding bit in the MPEG header. The program doesn't modify the audio data, and the files that are produced by the program can't be used by DCC-Studio. Written by Jac Goudsmit. Public domain; see the included source code for more information.
