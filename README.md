# DCC
Information about, and software for Digital Compact Cassette
by Jac Goudsmit

## Overview
This repository contains all the information I have about DCC, except for the DCC-FAQ. The purpose is to get this information back into the world and prevent it from being lost.

The DCC-FAQ is currently located at (http://xs4all.goudsm.it/dcc-faq.html). It hasn't been really maintained since 1997 and though there is interesting information in there, it's definitely outdated and probably incomplete. A better source of generic information about DCC is the [English Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Compact_Cassette) which I also mostly wrote, and maintain on a somewhat regular basis (I go there a few times a year and check the latest edits to make sure nothing bad sneaks in).

The most important DCC recorder from a 2017 point of view is probably the DCC-175 which, in combination with the PC-Link cable, was capable of being controlled by a computer with a Centronics printer port, running Windows 3.x or 9x. The DCC-Studio software was an easy to use program that was capable of copying tapes to hard disk and vice versa, and use a keyboard instead of a remote control to edit title information. It was also possible to create compilation tapes ("mix tapes") without having to stay with the recorder, and the Studio program would record the text information at the start of each track on the fly while it recorded the music to tape.

Nevertheless, any text that was recorded on "Super User Tapes" (with a second-generation recorder or with DCC-Studio) could not be read and/or shown on the display of first generation recorders (including the DCC-175, ironically). There was never any hardware or software available for DCC owners to create a tape that had the same information as a prerecorded tape, i.e. song titles of all songs (not just the currently playing song) and time codes of all songs (so that the recorder could determine which way to wind/rewind to find the start of a specific song title). This repository may or may not be the start of a new project to reverse-engineer the prerecorded format, and reproduce it using either the PC-Link cable or a hacked DCC recorder, and possibly a microcontroller and some extra hardware.
